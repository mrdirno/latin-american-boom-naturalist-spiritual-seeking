  "cover_prompt": "A young indigenous shaman and a ninety-four-year-old mystic with a face like weathered bark are urgently guiding a canoe carved with ancestral symbols through the flooded, vine-choked arteries of a sentient jungle, their faces a mix of determination and awe. The scene is a dense, hyper-detailed Amazonian river at the moment of magical inundation, where the water itself glows with bioluminescent algae and the submerged roots of giant kapok trees pulse with a soft, internal light, merging the scientific and the mythic. In the breathtakingly detailed and immersive magical realist style of botanical illustrator Margaret Mee and the mystical, textured environments of Moebius, with the atmospheric depth of Thomas Cole's wilderness. Dramatic book cover composition, centered on the canoe with a low-angle perspective that emphasizes the towering, dripping canopy and the immense, dreaming river, creating a sense of both peril and sacred journey. Ethereal, dappled lighting filters from the canopy above, mixing with the eerie aquatic glow from below in a palette of deep emerald greens, murky earth browns, luminous turquoise, and flashes of spectral gold and indigo. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."

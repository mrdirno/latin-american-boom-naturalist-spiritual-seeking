## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write the letter from Camilo's grandfather that accompanied the jaguar-pelt-wrapped bones. What history, guilt, or prophecy does it contain?
- Describe a 'conversation' between Ofelia and the dreaming yagé brew. What visions does it share, and what does it ask for?
- Craft a chapter from the perspective of the jungle itself, sensing the displaced humans and the sacred object moving through its veins.
- Imagine an encounter with a modern scientist studying the flooding, whose data-driven reality violently clashes with Camilo and Ofelia's journey.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of the delta, where rising water levels dynamically reveal and obscure 'mythic waypoints' and practical landmarks.
- Create a generative text system that simulates the 'dreaming brew,' producing poetic, prophetic fragments based on environmental inputs (time, weather, location).
